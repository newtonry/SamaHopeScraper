# SamaHope Scraper
## Scraping data from SamaHope into our Parse backend

To run rolling updates to update project numbers, run "ruby auto_update_projects.rb"

You can currently run this just by "ruby scraper.rb"
Might need to install some gems.
Also, you need a keys.rb file with the following:
PARSE_APP_ID = ......
PARSE_REST_API_KEY = ......
PARSE_JS_KEY = ......
